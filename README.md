# RazorPoker
An experimental work-in-progress upload of code to calculate scores, manage holdings, deal hands and (possibly) 
produce a working game at some point.

This originally started as an exercise to write a Texas Hold'em game in ASP MVC 3 and the Razor view engine. 
We're now up to MVC 5.2 and the new goal is to separate the game logic from the presentation and continue to
experiment with different view layers. At some point I'll add a desktop WPF, Silverlight and maybe even a Blend view.
